# Primea Project

*Primea Project* is our Mini PC project that embodies Primecoin's technology and values.

### Standard Based

We prefer a standard-based design. The PC standard was designed at a time when upgradability and repairability were priorities in the industry. In the recent decades major manufactures appears to be pro a culture of planned obsolescence and are eager to deviate from standards and serviceability given any opportunity, as upgradability, repairability and longevity are negatives on the bottom line for the major corporations.

Standard-based modular design allows each component to be upgraded or repaired separately, thus reducing waste and the overall cost of ownership.

The initial design of Primea supports the *Thin Mini-ITX* Standard.
